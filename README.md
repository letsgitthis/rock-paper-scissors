# rock-paper-scissors

I wanted to go above and beyond with this assignment and create an HTML and CSS. 
After struggling for a bit, I learned about switch and went with that method to at least make the numbers on the score board go up.
I would like to go back in and write the 'if' statements, but I wanted the game to be played on screen and not in a notification.
Either way, I was able to follow along with how I was connecting each thing between the script to the HTML, and had to debug along the way.
I found that console.log"ing" each function one at a time, I could see if it would perform or have an error.
I wanted to leave the console.log"s" in each function so you could also see how it functions in the backend, 
since I don't have anything else indicating what is happening on screen.

Currently, the game functions. you can see what the computer chooses by going to the console. 
If you win a round, you gain a point.
If the computer wins a round, it gets a point.
If it's a tie, no points are added.
